ENSIME Sublime provides Scala support to Sublime Text 3.

The project is in active development.
Watch this space for news and improvements,
and submit issues to [our tracker](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-sublime/issues/new).

Note: Sublime Text 2 support is deprecated.
All active development is happening for Sublime Text 3.
If you are interest in Sublime Text 2 support, consider contributing to the
[Sublime Text 2 Branch](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-sublime/tree/ST2).

## Project status

The project is up and functional and supports a subset of the ENSIME features:

* error highlighting
* code completion (hit `.` followed by `ctrl-space` or `command-space`)
* goto definition
* type hints
* extract local, extract method
* add import, organize imports
* supports Scala 2.10 and 2.11

## Getting it going

### Overview

There are two parts to ENSIME:

- *ENSIME Server*, which compiles your code, and supplies metadata via an API.
  The standard way of starting a server is to use the *ENSIME SBT* plugin.

- *ENSIME Sublime*, which runs inside Sublime Text and acts as a client to ENSIME Server.
  You enter commands in Sublime Text, ENSIME Sublime talks to the server,
  and answers magically appear on your screen.

To use ENSIME Sublime you need to follow four steps:

1. *Prepare your system* (one-off).
   Install Java and SBT.

2. *Set up ENSIME Sublime* (one-off).
   Install Sublime Text and ENSIME Sublime.

3. *Set up SBT* (once per projet).
   Install the ENSIME SBT plugin and configure ENSIME Server.

4. *Connect ENSIME Sublime to ENSIME Server* (once per editor session).
   Run a menu command in Sublime Text and start editing.

Read on for an in-depth description of each step.

### Prepare your system

Sublime Text needs to be able to see `java` and `sbt` on your system application path.
Note that this may not be the same as the path in your shell.

1. Ensure you have a JDK installed and visible on your system application path.

   The easiest way to do this is to run the Oracle or Open JDK install and
   select a system-wide install.

2. Ensure you have SBT 0.13.x installed and visible on your system application path.

   The easiest way to do this is to use the default installation option
   on the [SBT download page](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

Java and SBT should now be installed. The next step is to install Sublime Text (if necessary) and ENSIME Sublime.

See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below to check whether Sublime Text can see `java` and `sbt`.

### Set up ENSIME Sublime

1. Install [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
   (if you do not have it installed already).

2. Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Ensime),
   which makes it easy to install and uninstall Sublime Text plugins.

3. Install Ensime via Package Control:

   1. Open the Command Palette (*Tools Menu / Command Palette...*).

   2. Type/select *"Package Control: Install Package"* and press *Enter*.

   3. After a few seconds a second command palette will appear,
      asking you which package you'd like to install.

      Type/select *"Ensime"* and press *Enter*.

Sublime Text and ENSIME Sublime should now be correctly configured. The next step is to install ENSIME SBT.

### Set up SBT

1. Install the ENSIME SBT plugin by following the installation instructions
   in the [ENSIME SBT README](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-sbt#install).

   You can do this once per user by adding ENSIME SBT as a global plugin (recommended),
   or once per project by editing each project's `plugins.sbt` file individually.

2. Once you have installed ENSIME SBT, run the following command within SBT
   to generate a `.ensime` config file for ENSIME Server:

   ~~~
   > gen-ensime
   ~~~

   The first time you run this command it will take a while to complete
   (and it will download much of the internet).

   You need to run this command once per project before you connect Ensime Sublime,
   You will also need to re-run it whenever you change your `libraryDepdencies`.

### Connect ENSIME Sublime to ENSIME SBT

Once you have a `.ensime` file for your project,
you can use ENSIME Sublime to start and stop a complete ENSIME session
(including starting and stopping ENSIME Server):

1. Open your project root folder (the one containing the `.ensime` file) in Sublime Text.

2. Use the Sublime Text command palette to start ENSIME:

   1. Open the Command Palette (*Tools Menu / Command Palette...*).

   2. Type/select *"Ensime: Startup"*.

      If this menu item doesn't appear, check *No Commands in the Command Palette?*
      in the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

   3. Open a Scala file and verify that ENSIME is working.
      See the next section for more information.

## What Does ENSIME Sublime Do?

Once you have run the *"Ensime: Startup"* command,
ENSIME Sublime will enrich your Scala experience with the following features:

- Syntax highlighting
  - Highlighting is semantic rather than regex-based.
  - If you make a mistake, it is outlined in red.

- Mouse commands
  - Right-clicking yields useful context menu items.
  - `Ctrl-Click` or `Cmd-Click` invokes *Go to Definition*.
  - `Alt-Click` invokes *Inspect Type at Point*.

- Keyboard
  - Typing `Ctrl-Space` will show an autocomplete menu.
  - Other keybindings can be added via keymaps (see below).

## Additional Configuration

### Line Endings (Windows Users)

Windows users should ensure the `Line Endings` setting is set to `Unix`.
Go to *View Menu / Line Endings* and select *Unix*.

### Mouse Clicks

ENSIME Sublime customizes mouse bindings.
It makes `Ctrl+Click`/`Cmd+Click` invoke `Go to Definition`
and `Alt+Click` stand for `Inspect Type at Point`.

These bindings can be altered in the the config:
*Preferences Menu / Package Settings / Ensime / Mousemap - Default*.

### Key Bindings

`Ctrl+Space` invokes code completion by default.

Other keybindings can be enabled in the config:
*Preferences Menu / Package Settings / Ensime / Keymap - Default*.

## Troubleshooting

### Checking Java and SBT Visiblity

Unsure whether Sublime Text can see Java and SBT on your system application path?
Try pasting the following commands one at a time into the Sublime Text console
(*View menu / Show Console*).

On Linux or OS X:

~~~ python
# Check the visibility of Java:
import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['which', 'java'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode("utf-8"))

# Check the visibility of SBT:
import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['which', 'sbt'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode("utf-8"))
~~~

On Windows:

~~~ python
# Check the visibility of Java:
import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['where', 'java'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode("utf-8"))

# Check the visibility of SBT:
import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['where', 'sbt'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode("utf-8"))
~~~

In each case you should see a path string, something like this:

~~~
b'/usr/bin/java\n'
~~~

If you see and error message like this, Sublime Text can't see the relevant executable:

~~~
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "./subprocess.py", line 589, in check_output
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['which', 'java']' returned non-zero exit status 1
~~~

### Checking Java and SBT Versions

Ideally you should be using Java 8 and SBT 0.13.x.
To check this, paste the following commands one at a time into the console
(*View Menu / Show Console*):

~~~ python
# Check the Java version:
import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['java', '-version'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode("utf-8"))

# Check the SBT version:
import subprocess; print(subprocess.check_output(['sbt', 'sbtVersion'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode("utf-8"))
~~~

### No Commands in the Command Palette?

If your command palette doesn't contain the *Ensime: Startup* menu item,
it is most likely because ENSIME Sublime can't find your `.ensime` file:

- Ensure you have created a `.ensime` file using the `gen-ensime` command.

  If you have recently (re)generated your `.ensime` file,
  you may have to quit and restart Sublime Text to pick up the changes.

- Ensure the top-most item in the Side Bar (*View Menu / Side Bar / Show Side Bar*)
  is your project directory (the one containing the `.ensime` file).

  If not, choose *File Menu / Open...* and open the project directory directly.

### Line Endings

If you find that some features of Ensime are not working properly
(e.g. *Go To Definition* or *Error Highlighting*), check the *Line Endings* setting in Sublime Text.

On Windows, the line endings is set to *Windows* by default. ENSIME Sublime requires it to be *Unix*.
Change the setting by going to *View menu / Line Endings* and selecting *Unix*.

Also check *View menu / Console* for log information.

## Tips for ENSIME Developers

If you are hacking on ENSIME Sublime, there are a few things you may want to do differently.

### Installing ENSIME Sublime

Rather than installing ENSIME Sublime via Package Control, check out the Git repo
directly into the directory you end up in when you choose *Preferences / Browse Packages*.

This will Sublime Text to pick up changes in the plugin codebase live as you edit it!

### Configuring ENSIME Sublime

By default, when you run the *Ensime: Startup* command, ENSIME Sublime starts a new instance of ENSIME Server.
If you are hacking on ENSIME Server, you may find it useful to disable this behaviour.

To get ENSIME to connect to a pre-existing server instead,
go to *Preferences / Package Settings / Ensime / Settings - User` and add the following config entry:

~~~ javascript
{
  // other config entries...
  "connect_to_external_server": false
}
~~~

To revert to the default behaviour, set the entry back to `true`.
